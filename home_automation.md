# Ideas
- Garage light turns off each night at bedtime
- outdoor light setup that turns on at dusk
- Sound system for house
    - pass control to a new phone via NFC tag? Build the tag into a counter/wall/semi-permanent location, and tap phone-to-tag to take over music control
- Floor lamps in downstairs bedroom paired so they turn on with a specific light in the room
- coffee maker
- add a magnetic sensor on the garage door. If home is in "away mode" and the garage door goes from closed to open, turn on a few specific lights
    - Light in mud-room, kitchen, and entry-way

## NFC
- Add TP to the shopping list
- tag by door into garage to put home into "away mode" to turn off lights
