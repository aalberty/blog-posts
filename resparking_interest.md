# Finding the "spark"

Loss of interest in programming as you get further in and you realize how hard it all is, and that you'll be forced to do it even when you don't feel like it via work, etc.

How do you keep the passion for it alive given all of the "suffering" associated with it? Go back to your roots re: why you found it interesting to begin with.

## What do each of the following have in common?
- Legos
- League of Legends
- Destiny 2


Commonalities:
- rapid prototyping; try a build. If it doesn't work, tweak/scrap it and try again.
- optimizing for efficiency
- competition with others and self
- many different ways to solve the same problem, up to me to theorize which I think will work best, and then test my theory

How can these relate to programming?

> Debugging is, at its core, a manifestation of the scientific method; You gather data, make predictions, and test those predictions with experiments. Experiments yield new data, and you update your predictions, and hopefully come out the other side with a proper understanding.
